# FaceRecon 0.1

Built this back when I was in school, messing around with face recognition, Python GUIs, and databases.
It’s a local desktop app that recognizes faces from images, pulls info from a MySQL database, and also fetches information on the recognized person from Wikipedia.  
Not polished, not maintained, but yeah — it works.

## 🚀 Features

- GUI interface for inserting new faces into the database
- Face recognition via file upload
- Database search for stored descriptions
- Wikipedia integration for face-related context
- Simple local database setup with MySQL

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
